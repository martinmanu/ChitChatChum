# Character Avatars

This folder contains avatar images for each character. When you switch characters using the `/characters` command, the bot will automatically change its profile picture to match the selected character.

## Adding Avatar Images

1. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF
   - Size: Recommended 512x512 pixels or larger
   - File size: Under 8MB

2. **Naming Convention:**
   The avatar files should match the character keys in config.json:
   - `archer.png` - for the Archer character
   - `barbarian.png` - for the Barbarian character
   - `king.png` - for the Barbarian King
   - `queen.png` - for the Archer Queen
   - `hogrider.png` - for the Hog Rider
   - `warden.png` - for the Grand Warden
   - `champion.png` - for the Royal Champion
   - `minion.png` - for the Minion
   - `woody.png` - for Woody
   - `pirate.png` - for Captain Blackbeard
   - `wizard.png` - for Gandalf the Wise
   - `robot.png` - for R2-D2 Assistant
   - `detective.png` - for Sherlock Holmes
   - `walter.png` - for Walter White

3. **Where to Find Images:**
   - Clash of Clans characters: Official Clash of Clans wiki or game assets
   - Other characters: Search for official artwork or create your own
   - AI-generated: Use tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion

4. **Important Notes:**
   - Discord has rate limits for changing bot avatars (2 changes per hour)
   - If no avatar file exists, the bot will keep its current avatar
   - Make sure you have permission to use any images you add

## Example Usage

After adding avatar images to this folder, use the `/characters` command in Discord to see the interactive character selection menu. When you click a character button, the bot will:
1. Change its personality/responses to match the character
2. Attempt to change its username to the character name
3. Attempt to change its avatar to the character image

Enjoy your character roleplay bot! ðŸŽ­
